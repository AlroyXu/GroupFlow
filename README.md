GroupFlow
=========

This project aims to create a POX fork/extension of the NOX-Classic Castflow implementation, supplemented with full IGMP v3 support implemented in the controller. This will allow SDN multicast proposals to be deployed in a live OpenFlow SDN network with standard IGMPv3 hosts. The end goal of this project is to provide a testbed for developers aiming to test new multicast ideas in a software defined network.
